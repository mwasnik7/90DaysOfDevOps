# Advanced Git & GitHub Challenge Completion

I'm excited to share my successful completion of the "Advanced Git & GitHub for DevOps Engineers" challenge. This day was dedicated to exploring advanced Git concepts, including branching, reverting, resetting, rebasing, and merging.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Git Branching:** I've deepened my understanding of branching in Git, enabling me to efficiently manage code development in parallel, work on features, and merge changes seamlessly.

- **Git Revert and Reset:** I've mastered the techniques of reverting and resetting commits, which allows for precise control over project history and corrections when needed.

- **Git Rebase:** I've explored Git rebase, a powerful tool for maintaining a linear project history and streamlining the integration of feature branches into the main branch.

- **Git Merge:** Understanding Git merge has allowed me to combine changes from different branches into a single branch, ensuring a cohesive codebase.

## Exploratory Blog Post

For a detailed account of my experiences, insights, and practical applications during this challenge, I've documented my journey in a Medium blog post. You can access it [here](https://medium.com/@mwasnik7/day10-90daysofdevops-40d903e8e5be).

This advanced knowledge of Git and GitHub further enhances my capabilities in version control, code management, and collaboration within the DevOps ecosystem.

Onward in the DevOps journey!
