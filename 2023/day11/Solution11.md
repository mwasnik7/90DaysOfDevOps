# Advanced Git & GitHub Part 2 Challenge Completion
Day11 of 90DaysOdDevOps challenge
I'm thrilled to share my successful completion of the "Advanced Git and GitHub Part 2" challenge. This day was dedicated to delving further into advanced Git concepts, including Git stash, cherry-pick, and conflict resolution.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Git Stash:** I've gained proficiency in using Git stash to save changes temporarily, switch to another branch, and reapply the changes when needed, ensuring smooth context-switching during development.

- **Cherry-pick:** I've explored the cherry-pick command, enabling me to pick specific commits from one branch and apply them to another, facilitating targeted code integration.

- **Resolving Conflicts:** Understanding conflict resolution has equipped me to effectively address and merge conflicting changes during collaborative development, ensuring code integrity.

## Exploratory Blog Post

For a more detailed account of my experiences, insights, and practical applications during this challenge, I've documented my journey in a Medium blog post. You can access it [here](https://medium.com/@mwasnik7/day11-90daysofdevops-45083baf1789).

This advanced knowledge of Git and GitHub empowers me to manage complex development scenarios, streamline code integration, and collaborate effectively within DevOps projects.

Onward in the DevOps journey!
